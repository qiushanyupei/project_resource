HALLO AND WET ENTO THIS RECOLLING WOT TO YOU BY THE BRITISH COUNCIL A BEACH BY JOHN RUSSEL IMAGINE A BEACH A QUIET PLACE WITH ONLY THE NOISE OF THE SEA AND THE GULLS IN THE BACKGROUND THERE ARE BOATS FLOATING NEAR THE SHORE AND A FEW PEOPLE SWIMMING IN THE WATER NEX TO THEM IT'S A HOT DAY AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE LYING ON THE SAND ENJOYING THE SUNSHINE AND SLOWLY GOING BROUND THERE ARE NO SHOPS NO PEOPLE MAKING NOISES KNOW LOUD MUSIC EVERYTHING IS PEACEFUL THERE IS JUST THE SEA THE SUN AND THE BEACH A LITTLE PARADISE WERE IS IT THE BEACH IS ON THE SOUTH COAST OF SCOTLAND NEAR A LITTLE TOWN CALLED GATE HOUSE OF FLEET IN THE COUNTY OF DUMFRICE AND GALLAWAY TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO MY FAMILY AND I FOUND THIS PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE HAVE NEVER REALLY LEFT IT EVERY YEAR IN THE SUMMER WHILE OTHER PEOPLE GO ON HOLIDAY TO FOREIGN COUNDTRIES AND EXOTIC PLACES WE GO TO OUR PRIVATE PARADICE AND RELAX HERE IS A LITTLE CAMPSIHT WITH TENTS AND CARAVANS NEXT TO THE BEACH AND THIS BECOMES OUR HOME FOR ONE MONTH EVERY YEAR GROWING UP FOR A CHILD A BEACH IS A WONDERFUL PLACE HERE I FOUND LOTS OF SPACE TO RUN AND PLAY ON THE SAND OR TO SWIMMIN THE WATER BEING A CAMPSIGT THERE WERE ALWAYS LOTS OF OTHER FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN TO PLAY WITH ANOTHER OF MY FAVORITE ACTIVITIES WAS CLIMBING ON THE ROCKS AND CLIFFS AROUND THE BEACH ROCK POOLS WERE VERY EDUCATIONAL PLACES WHERE I USED TO STUDY THE LITTLE FISH AND SEA ANIMALS SILENCE WAS ALSO IMPORTAND AT SCHOOL I WAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE AND NOIS BUT THE BEACH GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO BE ON MY OWN AND THINK OR REED ARE WAY FROM ANYONE ELSE STORMS ALTHOUGH THE SEA CAN BE BEAUTIFUL THIS BEACH IS SOME TIMES A DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD THERE ARE OFTEN STORMS WITH STRONG WINDS WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE WAVES CAN GET UP TO TWO TO THREE METERS HIGH DEFINITELY NOT WEATHER FOR SWIMMING EVERY YEAR SOME OF THE BOATS ANCHORED ON THE BEACH ARE LOST BECAUSE THE SEA IS SO ROUGH I REMEMBER HOLDING DOWN OUR TENT TO STOP THE WIND BLOWING IT AWAY ON MANY OCCASIONS HOWEVER IF THE WAVES WEREN'T TOO HIGH ALL THE CHILDREN AND SOME ADULTS USED TO GO SWIMMING IN LIFE JACKETS AS IT WAS VERY EXCITING AN INTERESTING HOBBY SAILING IS OF VERY SERIOUS ACTIVITY IN THE UCAY AND THIS BEACH IS NO DIFFERENT THERE ARE LARGE RACING BOATS FOR THREE OR MORE PEOPLE SMALLER BOATS SUCH AS THE TOPPER FOR JUST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE FISHING BOATS AND WIND SURFASE IN FACT PEOPLE ON THIS BEACH A WILLING TO TRY ANY TYPE OF WATER SPORT WATER SKIING SPEED BOATING EVEN THE RECENT SPORT OF SAIL SURFING IS BECOMING POPULAR OVER THE YEARS MY FAMILY HAS HAD FOUR DIFFERENT BOATS FROM A SMALL TOPPER TO A LARGE CAPRICE FOR RACING SEA LINK FOR PITTURE WE HAVE SAILED RASTE AND FISHED OFF THE BOATS AND OF EVEN CAPSIZED IN BAD WEATHER A FEW TIMES SOROUNDINGS IF THIS BEACH HAD BEEN NEXT TO A TOWN OR NEAR A POPULAR TOURIST AREA AD ONT THINK WE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED GOING THERE BUT IT'S LO CATION IS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF GREEN COUNTRY SIDE WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANTS AND FLOWERS AND IN THE BACKGROUND THE HILLS OF GALLAWAY CAN BE SEEN LOTS OF PHOTOGRAPHERS AND ARTISTS COME TO THE AREA ALSO KNOWN AS THE SOLWAY BECAUSE THEY CAN CAPTURE SUCH BEAUTIFUL SCENERY A REFUCH EVEN AFTER TWENTY TWO YEARS THE BEACH IS STILL A SANCTUARY FOR ME IT'S A PLACE AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WHERE I CAN FORGET ABOUT LIFE'S PROBLEMS AND JUST RELAX IN TO DAYS MODDEN BUSY WORLD EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE LIKE THIS WE HOPE YOU'VE EN JOYED THIS RECORDING TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BRITISH COUNCL AND THE SERVITIS WE ATER
